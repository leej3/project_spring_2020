## Package Description
<br>
This aim of this package is to process raw tab-delimited output returned from the ExpansionHunter-Targeted 
software tool, used for making sequence-graph-based predictions of repeat lengths for known genetic repeat loci. 
The ultimate goal is to clean, compile, and process data for many different loci into a summary table, and to 
provide visualizations pertinent to the functional relevance of this data (i.e. number of samples containing 
repeat numbers above the pathogenic threshold for each gene).  

More information on ExpansionHunter can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/22/4754/5499079).
