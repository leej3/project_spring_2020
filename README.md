I will do a project, too.

A change

Hi. My project is to practice data manipulating and visualization, which is supposed to be useful in my future work. The idea is to gather the information of Nobel Prize winners and 1- visualize the distribution of winnersâ€™ country, age, gender, 2- compare the age difference between prize categories, 3- incorporating the information of research and development spending of each country, to see if this is related to the number of Nobel Prize winner.
I will mostly use pandas and matplotlib.pyplot to process csv files.
